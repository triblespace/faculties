# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

- **The nomic embedder's tokenizer loads from a native tokenizer GRAPH.**
  `load_text_embedder` constructs the `tokenizers::Tokenizer` directly from
  the tokenizer graph in the text model pile
  (`mary::persist::load_tokenizer_from_pile` → the `tokenizers` builders) —
  no tokenizer.json parse, no temp-file materialization, no network at
  runtime. The json blob import (`memory import-tokenizer`) is retained for
  provenance and now also builds the graph; the new `memory ingest-tokenizer`
  upgrades a blob-only pile in place (append-only, idempotent). Piles without
  a graph fall back to the blob with a stderr warning. Requires mary ≥
  8e0f023 (tokenizer-graph merge).
- **Compass is workflow-neutral again.** The never-released structured review
  gate has been removed wholesale: no review status coupling, request,
  attestation, verdict, settlement, override, watermark, or dedicated review
  panel remains. Compass once again accepts arbitrary status names and presents
  `todo`, `doing`, `blocked`, and `done` as its four defaults. Ordinary notes
  may now carry the same optional `$PERSONA` attribution as status events.
  Historical unknown facts remain preserved by the append-only pile.
- **Compass notes are addressable ledger records.** Note creation and `show`
  expose stable note IDs; repeatable tags, opaque exact references, and
  displayed `metadata::supersedes` edges add composable provenance without
  hiding history or creating workflow. Inline `faculty:hex` links materialize
  references as exhaust. Orient wakes once for newly visible foreign or
  unattributed notes on relevant goals (or directly tagged notes), keeps own
  notes quiet, upgrades legacy checkpoints without a flood, and unions seen
  note-ID deltas across persona checkpoints. This prevents later replay after
  divergent checkpoints are committed without claiming a simultaneous
  exactly-once delivery lock, and keeps persisted note history linear.
- **Codex can enforce orient-watcher continuity and ingest news while busy.**
  Versioned SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, and Stop hook helpers under
  `hooks/codex/` hand the `liora-gpt` watcher to each new primary thread, clear
  stale invisible consumers, inject non-consuming `orient poll --peek` news at
  prompt boundaries, and require one rearm attempt before a turn can idle.
- **Group broadcasts are first-class inbox messages.** `message list` and
  `orient show` now include messages addressed to any group the reader belongs
  to, matching `orient wait` wakeups and keeping read acknowledgements scoped
  to the individual reader.
- **Widgets are enabled by default.** A stock `cargo build`, `cargo test`, or
  `cargo install --bins` now includes the GORBIE viewer/capture surface, so the
  shipped widget examples compile in the default configuration. Use
  `--no-default-features` for a CLI-only build.
- **Archive search indexes are commit-native, resumable LSM forests.** Each
  source commit becomes one logical Succinct + BM25 leaf (large commits may be
  physically sharded), and both manifests carry an atomic coverage certificate.
  Live writes maintain both indexes in the same branch repoint; an unhooked
  writer makes search fail stale instead of silently omitting messages.
  `archive index` now walks uncovered commit metadata parents-first, checkpoints
  after each commit, resumes after interruption, and is a true no-op once both
  indexes cover the archive HEAD. It discards uncertified legacy forests and
  rebuilds certified manifests whose segment blobs are unreadable. Search
  validates BM25 + Succinct coverage from one branch-head snapshot before any
  attachment and reads the succinct segments only when lexical hits need
  materialising; the legacy monolithic rollup is no longer rebuilt or consulted.
  A dedicated archive build can opt large Succinct carries into the reusable
  WGPU backend with `--no-default-features --features gpu-succinct`; the normal
  build stays GPU-free, canonical segment bytes are shared, and returned
  accelerator errors retry on CPU before any manifest replacement.
- **Archive list and search are indexed-only reads.** `archive list` now
  validates and attaches the branch-head Succinct manifest instead of checking
  out the entire raw archive, k-way merges each segment's reverse
  `created_at` AVE cursor, and stops after validating `--limit` complete
  messages. Author/content blobs are fetched only for those winners. Missing
  or stale coverage fails with an `archive index` repair hint. The
  archive-scale substring `search --exact` / `--case-sensitive` escape hatch
  is removed; search never silently or explicitly falls back to a full
  checkout.
- **Archive and memory BM25 search can retrieve standalone Unicode
  symbols.** The shared tokenizer now indexes non-ASCII symbol graphemes,
  so queries such as emoji take the normal indexed path instead of yielding
  no terms (or forcing a full exact scan). Run `archive index` / `memory
  index` once to add symbol postings to an existing pile.
- **`faculties-viewer` renamed to `viewer`.** Binary, `[[bin]]`
  target, and docs all follow; `--version` now prints
  `viewer X.Y.Z (<git hash>)`. No compat alias.
## 0.20.2 — 2026-06-10

- **Re-bundle `trible` CLI at 0.46.4** — publisher-first sync fix
  (closure walks no longer stall on unreachable DHT; the announcing
  peer is used directly), validated by the new deterministic sim
  suite upstream. This is the release that makes multi-peer sync
  work out of the tarball.
- **wiki: deterministic version + tag ids** — version ids minted from
  (fragment, title, content); tag ids content-derived from the
  lowercased name. Identical content converges across piles on merge
  instead of forking. `create --id <hex>` for pre-minted stable
  fragment ids; `--force` tolerates dangling links at write time.
- **bootstrap pile: fully-linked tour** — stable fragment ids, hub +
  next-stop navigation spine (0 orphans), new "Substrate 4/4: The
  Architecture — Zero Sync Code" fragment, substrate trio numbering
  1/4..4/4, codex fragment dropped (provider-specific advice removed
  from a provider-agnostic pile).
- **orient: per-process persona** — `--persona <label-or-hex>` /
  `$PERSONA` env; the pile-config persona path is removed (multiple
  agents share one pile but must not share one identity).
- **faculties-viewer**: widgets for every data-bearing faculty,
  reason+archive in the activity timeline, live NOW markers,
  sections start collapsed (headless captures force-open),
  `--pile` flag precedence: --pile > positional > PILE env > default.
- **mail/decide: i128::MIN negation overflow fixed** in sort keys.
- **GORBIE dependency: 0.18.1 from crates.io** — the temporary
  [patch.crates-io] path override is removed; `cargo install --git`
  works from any clone again.

## 0.20.1 — 2026-06-10

- **Re-bundle `trible` CLI at 0.46.3** (release tarballs pull latest
  from crates.io at build time). The v0.20.0 tarballs shipped trible
  0.46.0, which predates two join-handshake fixes:
  - CapDeliveryConfirmed lookup matches by sig handle, not cap
    handle (0.46.1) — `team request-join` confirmation no longer
    misses.
  - `team approve` + remaining team subcommands route through
    `with_pile` so `close()` runs on every exit path (0.46.3).
  No faculty-side code changes.
- **wiki: unknown tag in `list --tag` matches zero fragments**
  instead of silently degrading to an unfiltered listing. Same for
  `--with-backlink-tag`; unknown tags in `--without-backlink-tag`
  still correctly exclude nothing.
- **bootstrap: substrate-concepts trio** — three new onboarding
  fragments (Substrate 1/3 tribles, 2/3 pile, 3/3 monotonic merge)
  covering the "why does this work" layer behind the workflow
  fragments. Indexed from Getting Started; fragment count 16 → 19.

## 0.20.0 — 2026-06-05

- **Bump `triblespace` 0.45 → 0.46 and `GORBIE` 0.17 → 0.18.**
  Picks up the new `PinSnapshot` type and `PinStore::pin_snapshot()`
  trait method in triblespace-core (cheap O(refcount-bump)
  snapshot of the pin → head map via the Pile's internal PATCH),
  the snapshot-first publish ordering in triblespace-net (closes
  a race where a peer dialing in after a gossip hit a stale
  serving snapshot and got "out of scope" denials), and the
  OP_DELIVER_CAP swarm-fetch + dialer-equals-issuer verify path.
  No faculty-side code changes required.

## 0.19.0 — 2026-06-03

- **Bump `triblespace` 0.44 → 0.45 and `GORBIE` 0.16 → 0.17.**
  Picks up the PATCH `LocalLeaf` archive-leaf elimination in
  triblespace 0.45 (~47% memory savings on `SimpleArchive` ingest,
  archive ingest now at parity with or faster than the heap path
  at every scale tested), the `team revoke` removal (eviction is
  per-issuer non-renewal via `team retract`), and the GORBIE
  web-export proc macro for static-bundle notebook builds.
- **Widget batch.** New `atlas` (schema-catalog browser),
  `triage` (agent-activity diagnostic dashboard), `files` widget
  (import-history view), `gauge` (research-health dashboard),
  `memory` widget (recent-chunks viewer), `headspace`,
  `planner` (with now-line / full-width header polish),
  `discord` and `teams` widgets, plus `reason` and `archive`
  rendering in the timeline.
- **New `messages-capture` bin** for ingesting message streams.

## 0.18.0 — 2026-06-01

- **Loose-couple memory chunk provenance.** `memory create` no longer
  scans the cognition / archive branches and writes `about_exec_result`
  / `about_archive_message` references at chunk-write time. Provenance
  is now recovered by *temporal overlap* at read-time via the new
  `memory provenance <chunk-id>` subcommand, which lists every cognition
  exec result and archive message whose timestamps fall within the
  chunk's `[start_at, end_at]` interval. This means a chunk written
  before its source data is imported (e.g. a reflective summary written
  in one environment, with the matching .claude/chatgpt-data-dump
  imported later) automatically picks up its provenance when the data
  lands — no rewrite pass needed. The `ctx::about_exec_result` and
  `ctx::about_archive_message` attribute IDs remain declared in the
  schema so older chunks stay queryable and downstream consumers
  (`triage` etc.) keep working on legacy data.

## 0.17.0 — 2026-05-31

- **Bump `triblespace` 0.43 → 0.44 and `GORBIE` 0.15 → 0.16.**
  Picks up the descriptive-capabilities substrate in
  `triblespace-net` (cap blobs + chain proofs in sig blobs +
  `/triblespace/auth-handshake/1` ALPN + renewal daemon),
  the `BranchStore → PinStore` rename (Branch is now a
  specialization of Pin), `Repository::new` taking
  `F: Into<Fragment>`, and the engine improvements
  (NotAttr, full same-Variable handling, RegularPathConstraint
  symmetric end-bound proposal, path! infix `?`/`!`/`^`).
- **`triage`**: switch from `pile.branches()` to `pile.pins()`
  for the listing iterator; no behavioural change since the
  named-branch filtering happens downstream.

## 0.14.8 — 2026-05-17

- **Bump `triblespace` 0.41.3 → 0.41.4.** Two follow-on fixes
  surfaced by the first end-to-end sandbox-to-laptop sync:
  - **Trailing-dot leak through `ep.addr()`** — 0.14.7
    stripped dots from the outbound RelayMap but iroh's own
    `Endpoint::addr()` could still report the dotted form
    in our tickets. Outbound tickets are now dot-free; the
    `parse_peers` and `pile net pull <REMOTE>` paths also
    normalise inbound tickets so peers running unpatched
    builds get cleaned up at the receiving end.
  - **Connection reuse in `fetch_reachable`** — previously
    a BFS over a remote pile opened one ~600ms-auth
    connection per blob and per CHILDREN call, blowing the
    `pull_branch` 30s deadline on anything larger than ~30
    blobs. Now uses a single authed connection across the
    whole walk.

  Faculties source unchanged.

## 0.14.7 — 2026-05-17

- **Bump `triblespace` 0.41.2 → 0.41.3.** Picks up the
  trailing-FQDN-dot fix in `triblespace-net`. iroh's default
  relay hostnames (`*.iroh-canary.iroh.link.` — note the
  dot) were tripping strict WAFs that treat trailing-dot
  Host headers as bypass-attempt signatures (Anthropic web
  sandbox egress being the concrete case). `triblespace-net`
  now strips the dot before iroh constructs `RelayUrl`s,
  producing an HTTP-canonical Host header on the wire. Same
  relays, friendlier request shape.

  Practical effect: the bundled `trible` CLI in this release's
  precompiled tarballs should now successfully establish iroh
  relay sessions from inside Anthropic's web sandbox, which
  unblocks the gossip-mesh + DHT bootstrap path for live sync.
  Faculties source unchanged.

## 0.14.6 — 2026-05-17

- **Bump `triblespace` 0.41.1 → 0.41.2.** Picks up the
  StaticAddressLookup work in `triblespace-net`:
  `pile net sync --peers <EndpointTicket>` now bypasses
  iroh's discovery on the gossip/DHT bootstrap path, not
  just on `pile net pull`. Closes the
  "tickets-work-for-pull-but-not-sync" asymmetry from
  0.14.5. Faculties source unchanged.

  Practical effect for sandboxed users: the bundled `trible`
  CLI in this release's precompiled tarballs can now run a
  full bidirectional gossip sync against a ticketed peer
  without iroh discovery being reachable — relevant when
  iroh-canary 503s the discovery probes (claude.ai web
  sandbox shared-egress IP rate limiting) or DNS is
  filtered (corporate proxies).

## 0.14.5 — 2026-05-17

- **Bump `triblespace` 0.41.0 → 0.41.1.** Picks up the
  `EndpointTicket`-everywhere release in `triblespace-net` —
  the `Peer` API now accepts `impl Into<EndpointAddr>` on
  all peer-dialing methods, `trible pile net identity`
  prints an EndpointTicket, `trible pile net sync` prints a
  rich ticket at startup, and `trible pile net pull <REMOTE>`
  / `pile net sync --peers <STR>` accept tickets in addition
  to bare hex pubkeys.

  Practical effect for sandboxed `faculties` users: the
  precompiled `trible` CLI bundled in this release's
  tarballs can now dial peers directly via an EndpointTicket
  pasted into `--peers` (or as the `<REMOTE>` arg to pull),
  skipping iroh discovery entirely. That's the unblock for
  the Anthropic web sandbox where iroh-canary 503s the
  discovery probes (shared egress IP rate limiting).

  Source unchanged from 0.14.4.

## 0.14.4 — 2026-05-16

- **Bump `triblespace` 0.40 → 0.41, `GORBIE` 0.14.2 → 0.14.3.**
  Tracks the iroh-0.98 family upgrade in `triblespace-net
  0.41.0`, which is the proper upstream resolution for the
  ed25519-dalek 3.0.0-pre.1 / ed25519 3.0.0 compile failure
  that 0.14.3 worked around with a Cargo.lock pin in
  `trible 0.40.3`. Same end-user effect (sandbox-friendly
  precompiled binaries via the OS trust store), cleaner
  resolution path — fresh `cargo install trible` now picks a
  set that compiles end-to-end.

  Source identical to 0.14.3.

## 0.14.3 — 2026-05-16

- **Pick up `triblespace 0.40.2` + `GORBIE 0.14.2`.** Both
  bumps carry the same change end-to-end: the TLS roots that
  iroh's discovery layer trusts now come from the OS trust
  store (via `rustls-platform-verifier`) instead of the
  compiled-in Mozilla `webpki-roots` bundle. The previous
  webpki-roots default silently broke iroh's relay HTTPS
  probes and pkarr publish/lookup in corporate-proxy /
  sandbox environments that present a custom CA at egress —
  every probe returned `invalid peer certificate:
  UnknownIssuer` and discovery never got off the ground.

  Practical effect for sandboxed `faculties` users: the
  precompiled binaries produced from this tag's `release.yml`
  workflow can now reach iroh's public infrastructure from
  inside the Anthropic web sandbox (and similar
  TLS-intercepting environments). Normal environments are
  unaffected — the OS trust store already contains the
  Mozilla roots.

  Cargo.lock pins updated via
  `cargo update -p triblespace -p GORBIE`. Source unchanged.

## 0.14.0 — 2026-05-07

- **Bump `triblespace` 0.37 → 0.38, `GORBIE` 0.13 → 0.13.2.**
  Picks up the team-rooted-gossip release: the gossip mesh id
  is now derived directly from the team root pubkey, so users
  no longer pick + coordinate a separate `--topic` string with
  invitees. Bootstrap fragment 16 (auth setup recipe) updated
  in lock-step in a previous commit.
  Minor bump (pre-1.0 but breaking for downstreams pinning
  `faculties = "0.13"`) because the upstream change in
  `triblespace::net::peer::PeerConfig` re-exports through
  `faculties::widgets::storage` and the `--topic` flag removal
  is a user-facing change in the bundled `trible` CLI.

## 0.13.3 — 2026-05-07

- **README: fix stale `wiki create` example.** The CLI moved
  to positional `<TITLE> <CONTENT>` arguments; the README still
  showed the old `--title`/`--body` flag form. Other examples
  already match the current syntax.
- **Bundle the `trible` CLI in release tarballs.** Each
  per-target tarball now ships `trible` alongside the faculty
  bins (`compass`, `wiki`, `files`, …), so a single download
  delivers the whole pile-management toolkit. The release
  workflow `cargo install trible`s the latest crates.io
  version for the matrix target and copies the binary into
  the staging dir.

## 0.13.2 — 2026-05-07

- **CI-only fix.** v0.13.1's release workflow built past the
  wasm32 issue but tripped on `RUSTFLAGS: -D warnings` —
  pre-existing unused-import noise in the rust-script-ported
  bins (e.g. `src/bin/triage.rs::use std::fs;`) escalated to
  errors. Drop the deny; the release workflow's job is to ship
  working binaries, not enforce lint. A separate lint workflow
  can come back if/when we want to gate that on PRs.
  Lib source identical to v0.13.0.

## 0.13.1 — 2026-05-07

- **CI-only fix.** v0.13.0's release workflow died on every job
  with `wasm32-unknown-unknown target may not be installed`:
  triblespace 0.37 pulls `wasmi 0.31`, whose build script
  invokes rustc against `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. The workflow's
  rust-toolchain step only installed the per-target host
  triple. Fix:
  - add `wasm32-unknown-unknown` to the toolchain install,
  - swap `cross` for native arm64 Linux (GitHub now provides
    `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runners for free public repos), so the
    aarch64-linux job can install the wasm32 target via
    rustup like every other job.
  Lib source identical to v0.13.0; not republished to
  crates.io.

## 0.13.0 — 2026-05-07

- **Bump `triblespace` 0.36 → 0.37.** Aligns the CLI faculties
  + shared lib with the same triblespace release that GORBIE
  0.13 ships against — no more split between binaries on 0.36
  and the optional widgets stack pulling 0.37 transitively.
  Pre-1.0 minor bump, breaking for downstreams that pin
  `faculties = "0.12"`. (Bundles the v0.12.2 changes, which
  are not separately published.)

## 0.12.2 — 2026-05-07 (unpublished)

- **Bump optional `GORBIE` dep 0.12 → 0.13.** Picks up the
  GORBIE 0.13.x line: stacked floats no longer drag in
  lockstep, tall floats render at natural content height
  without a viewport-multiple cap, and the infinite-scroll
  feedback loop when a wiki/compass float was open is fixed.
  See GORBIE's CHANGELOG for the full notes.
- **Drop manual drag detection in `wiki` and `timeline`
  widgets.** Switch to egui's `Sense::click_and_drag` +
  z-aware `dragged()` / `drag_delta()`. Floats dragged
  across the wiki graph or the activity timeline no longer
  pan them in lockstep; the manual `primary_pressed && in_rect`
  + memory-id bookkeeping is gone.
- **Fix wiki graph label flip-overshoot.** When a node's
  label would overflow the right edge, the mirror-to-left
  path used `Align2::RIGHT_CENTER.anchor_rect` against an
  already-shifted origin — the label landed one whole
  galley-width further left than intended, sometimes
  clipping or appearing to wrap around to the viewport's
  left side. Pass the unshifted `left_anchor` so the
  label's right edge sits cleanly just left of the node.

## 0.12.1 — 2026-05-05

- **Drop stray `[patch.crates-io]` GORBIE local override.** v0.12.0
  shipped with `GORBIE = { path = "../GORBIE" }` in the manifest,
  which broke the release workflow (the GH runner has no sibling
  GORBIE checkout). Local dev overrides belong in
  `~/.cargo/config.toml` or a gitignored override file, not the
  published manifest. v0.12.0 source is identical otherwise; this
  is a CI-only fix.

## 0.12.0 — 2026-05-05

- **Faculties are real Cargo binaries now.** Every faculty moved
  from a `rust-script` shebang at the repo root into `src/bin/`,
  with the unioned dep set hoisted into `Cargo.toml`. Install
  with `cargo install --git ... --bins` (or grab a precompiled
  tarball from a tagged release). Invocation drops the `.rs`
  suffix: `wiki list`, `compass add ...`, etc. The `faculties`
  lib (schemas + widgets) is unchanged; binaries `use faculties::...`
  the same way external crates would.
- **GitHub Actions release workflow.** `v*` tags trigger per-target
  builds (`x86_64-linux-gnu`, `aarch64-linux-gnu` via cross,
  `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `aarch64-apple-darwin`) and attach
  tarballs + sha256s to the GH release. Restricted sandboxes can
  fetch binaries without a Rust toolchain.

## 0.11.2 — 2026-04-19

- **Theme-adaptive compass + messages.** `color_frame`, `card_bg`,
  `color_bubble`, `color_muted` now branch on `ui.visuals().dark_mode`
  so light-mode notebooks don't end up with dark-on-dark text.
- **Drags don't fight.** Both the wiki graph and the activity
  timeline only latch onto a drag whose press *started* inside
  their viewport — dragging a floating card across them no longer
  yanks the graph pan or the timeline offset.
- **Release hygiene.** LICENSE-MIT + LICENSE-APACHE committed,
  Cargo.toml gains authors/homepage/readme/keywords/categories,
  `.gitignore` excludes `*.pile` and `.bak-*` backups.

## 0.11.1 — 2026-04-19

- **`faculties-viewer` binary.** `cargo install faculties --features widgets`
  now installs a binary that composes all four widgets (activity
  timeline, wiki graph, compass kanban, local-messages) against a
  single pile. Mirror of `examples/pile_inspector.rs`.
- **Widgets polish.** Dozens of small rendering fixes for the demo:
  edge-to-edge viewports for the timeline and wiki graph; SPAN +
  zoom-hint overlay inside each viewport; colorhash-tinted fragment
  IDs, person chips, and tag chips; compass lanes now stack
  vertically; centered empty-state placeholders; search-miss banner.
- **GORBIE 0.12.** Bumps the optional GORBIE dep to 0.12.0 which
  pulls in the egui 0.34 hit-test workarounds.
- **CLI faculties on the published crate.** All rust-script
  faculties (`compass.rs`, `wiki.rs`, etc.) depend on
  `faculties = "0.11"` from crates.io instead of an absolute local
  path, so cloners build out of the box.

## 0.11.0

Previous releases were internal/path-based. See git history.
