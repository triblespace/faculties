//! **The framed-stream convention** — how a faculty carries a modality, in
//! either direction, over an ordinary pipe.
//!
//! # Why this is a crate
//!
//! It was a module in `drive` for one commit, because `soma/` and `faculties/`
//! were being edited concurrently and it touched neither. That was a scheduling
//! fact, not a design one: a convention only one program can link is not a
//! convention. A speech faculty, a camera faculty, `soma-client`'s capture
//! decoder — none of them wants a cognition loop, a sandbox client, or a pile,
//! and none of them should have to take one to agree with drive about what a
//! record is. So this crate is **std + anyhow**, has no dependency on drive, and
//! ships its own reference faculty (`framed_relay`) and its own
//! process-boundary gate, which is what lets its guarantees be tested by
//! whoever links it rather than by whoever happens to host it.
//!
//! # Why a pipe, and why framed
//!
//! Drive needs to hand a faculty a stream it is still producing: say "start
//! speaking" ONCE and then feed tokens in as it generates them, rather than
//! handing over one finished string. And it needs the other direction too — a
//! faculty that owns a device, a conversation, or a robot, reporting back
//! continuously.
//!
//! MCP cannot do this, and should not learn to. MCP is request/response: it
//! starts a tool call and the call returns. That makes it the perfect CONTROL
//! plane — the mind says "start speaking", and that is one request — but it can
//! never be the DATA plane, because there is no way to keep feeding a call that
//! has not returned. So the split is: **MCP (or a plain spawn) starts the
//! process and hands it a pipe; the streaming happens on the pipe.**
//!
//! A pipe, specifically, because that is what CLI tools already speak. A faculty
//! that reads content-typed framed records on stdin and writes them on stdout
//! composes with everything Unix has: `tee` it to a file, `nc` it to another
//! host, splice it into another faculty, capture it for a golden test. "Connect
//! to a robot" or "connect to a video call" stops being an integration and
//! becomes "something else that produces frames on a pipe".
//!
//! Most of what drive needs never crosses a sandbox at all: drive and the
//! faculties run side by side on the same host, so drive → a speech faculty is
//! ordinary local pipes with no playground in the path. That is the case this
//! module serves. (See *What the sandbox case would need*, below, for the one
//! that is not built here.)
//!
//! # The read half already existed
//!
//! `soma-client` is the prototype: Soma owns the microphone, emits one fixed
//! record per 80 ms frame with a `frame_index` and a `first_sample_index`, and a
//! consumer that misses a record gets a loud discontinuity error instead of
//! apparent silence. This module is that idea generalised off HTTP and onto
//! pipes, and made bidirectional and modality-agnostic — deliberately following
//! its two-clock scheme rather than inventing a second one.
//!
//! # The wire format
//!

//! ```
//!
//! # The four guarantees
//!
//! **1. Every record carries its content type.** The preamble declares the
//! stream's type; a record may override it with a non-empty type of its own, and
//! an empty type means "the stream's". So a record's type is always determinate
//! (this is what [`Record::content_type`] returns), a homogeneous stream pays
//! two bytes per record for the property, and a heterogeneous one — telemetry
//! interleaved with keyframes — needs no separate channel.
//!
//! **2. Continuity is checkable, in two clocks.** `index` counts records;
//! `offset` counts the modality's own unit — samples for PCM, bytes for text,
//! frames for video, whatever the preamble declares. A reader requires
//! `index == expected` and `offset == expected`, exactly as `soma-client`
//! requires both of its clocks, and advances `expected_offset` by the record's
//! declared `extent`. Two clocks rather than one because they catch different
//! lies: a dropped record breaks `index`, and a record that under- or
//! over-reports its own content breaks `offset`.
//!
//! **3. A producer that cannot keep up must SAY SO.** On a pipe, backpressure is
//! the default: a producer whose consumer is slow simply blocks in `write`. A
//! producer that must NOT block — a live device with a fixed clock — has exactly
//! one legal alternative: emit a [`Gap`] record naming what it
//! skipped and why, which advances both clocks explicitly. Silently renumbering
//! is not available: the reader would reject the next record. There is no path
//! by which missing content becomes apparent content.
//!
//! **4. "The producer ended" is distinguishable from "the pipe broke".** A
//! stream ends with an explicit END record carrying a status. A reader that hits
//! clean EOF *without* having seen END reports a TRUNCATED stream — because a
//! truncated stream and a complete short one are otherwise byte-identical, and
//! that ambiguity is the same class of failure as a missing binary reading as a
//! clean exit. A writer dropped without [`FramedWriter::finish`] makes a
//! best-effort attempt to write `END{aborted}` on the way out, so even a
//! panicking producer usually manages to say that it failed.
//!
//! # Carrying a modality it was not designed for
//!
//! Nothing above mentions audio. To carry a modality, a producer answers three
//! questions in the preamble and one per record:
//!
//! | | audio (PCM) | text/token stream | video | robot telemetry |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | `content_type` | `audio/L16;rate=24000;channels=1` | `text/plain;charset=utf-8` | `image/jpeg` | `application/json` |
//! | `unit` | `samples` | `bytes` | `frames` | `samples` |
//! | `extent` | samples in this record | bytes in this record | `1` | `1` |
//!
//! A consumer that does not understand a content type must refuse it loudly
//! ([`FramedReader::require_content_type`]) rather than treat the bytes as
//! whatever it expected. The framing layer is deliberately ignorant of all of
//! them: it moves length-delimited, content-typed, continuity-checked byte
//! records, and the modality lives entirely in the type string and the unit.
//!
//! # What the sandbox case would need (NOT built here)
//!
//! A process INSIDE a playground sandbox cannot be piped to from outside today.
//! `exec` runs to completion, `job_exec` polls for output, and `write` is
//! implemented as an exec with `stdin: Some(bytes)` — real byte-into-stdin
//! machinery, but one shot: the pipe closes when the call returns, and there is
//! a 3 MiB ceiling. Streaming into the sandbox needs one new playground verb:
//! *start a process and hold a bidirectional pipe open across the boundary*,
//! with the MCP call returning a handle rather than an output. This module needs
//! nothing else from it — the format, the continuity checks, and the
//! end-vs-broken distinction all work unchanged over whatever byte transport
//! that verb provides. It is bounded, real, and deliberately not built here.
//!
//! # What is proven, and what is not
//!
//! The unit tests at the foot of this file drive the encoding through in-memory
//! buffers; `tests/framed_stream.rs` drives real records through real OS pipes
//! into a real child process (`framed_relay`, the reference faculty), in both
//! directions at once, and proves every guarantee above including truncation
//! detection and gap accounting. What is NOT proven is any modality: nothing in
//! this crate produces PCM or video, so the audio row of that table is a
//! contract, not a measurement.
