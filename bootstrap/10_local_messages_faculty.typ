= Local Messages: Agent-to-Agent Direct Messaging

`local_messages` is the append-only DM primitive. Useful when
you want to leave a note for another agent (or a future-you) that
isn't a wiki fragment — it's transient, addressee-specific, with
read acknowledgements.

== When to use

  - Coordination between two agents on the same pile
    (e.g. "I'm taking over goal X, please don't touch it").
  - Hand-offs that need a read-receipt
    (`local_messages ack <id>`).
  - Notes-to-self that are time-sensitive but not durable enough
    for a wiki fragment.

== When NOT to use

  - Anything reusable across multiple readers — that's a wiki
    fragment. A message decays after the receiver acks it; a
    fragment stays queryable.
  - Long technical content — messages are conversational. If
    you're writing more than 5 lines, ask whether a fragment
    would serve better.
  - Real-time chat — the pile is eventually-consistent across
    relays. Messages land within seconds of a sync, but it's
    not a chat channel.

== Usage

```sh
# Send
local_messages send <recipient-handle> "your message"

# List recent (latest first)
local_messages list

# Mark as read
local_messages ack <message-id>
```

The recipient handle is whatever name maps to a person/agent in
the relations branch (`local_messages --help` shows the
`--relations-branch` flag for picking which branch holds those
mappings — `relations` by default).

== Branch and storage

Messages live on branch `local-messages` in the pile (default —
override via `--branch`). Each message is one append-only blob;
acknowledgements are separate appends, so the read history is its
own audit trail.

The pile-union for this branch is `cat`: when two pile copies
merge, all messages from both sides survive, no overwrites. So
sending the same message twice from different machines just
results in two messages, never lost data.
