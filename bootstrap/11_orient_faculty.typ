= Orient: The Situation-Snapshot Faculty

`orient` has six deliberately different modes. Use `wake` at session start or
after context compaction to recover the whole self: memory cover, cover-tagged
beliefs, and goals. Use `show` mid-session for the much smaller answer to "what
is going on right now?"; it deliberately contains neither memories nor Wiki
entries. `wait` blocks and also sweeps timer-driven Habits; `poll` performs the
same relational attention check once without blocking; `baseline` explicitly
marks the current attention set as already presented. `daemon` keeps the pile
open and delivers successive reports to one callback, without per-turn hooks.

== What it shows

`orient show` collates:

  - recent local messages
  - unread Mail
  - due Habits and Habit states needing attention
  - Compass goals in `doing`
  - Compass goals in `todo`
  - current window status

Defaults to ten messages, five doing goals, and five todo goals. The
`--message-limit`, `--doing-limit`, and `--todo-limit` flags tune those limits.
When a persona is set, `show` records the attention events it actually renders
as presented, after the complete report has been flushed.

== When to use it

  - `orient wake` at session start and after compaction
  - `orient show` after a pause or before context-switching
  - `orient poll` for a deliberate immediate news check
  - `orient wait` for a deliberate one-shot blocking check
  - `orient daemon` for persistent automatic notifications
  - `orient baseline` for an explicit quiet starting point

== `orient wait`

`orient wait` blocks until the maintained target collections at one
immutable pile snapshot contain news for this persona, rather than reporting
every raw pile append. Directed news includes unread
inbox or group messages, Compass goals and notes whose `@label` mentions name
the persona or any Relations group containing it, newly status-bearing windows,
and unread Mail. A goal tagged with the persona's own label is assigned to it:
other people's status changes and notes on that goal are news too. Group names
used as tags are topics and address nobody, and writing on a goal does not
subscribe the writer to it. The persona's own attributed notes, mentions, status
edits, and message acknowledgements stay quiet.

Orient owns no cursor, checkpoint, or shadow catalog. It derives the current
attention set directly from maintained collection snapshots and subtracts the
grow-only relational set `Presented(persona, event)`. A complete report is
flushed before its exact events are recorded as presented. `baseline` performs
that presentation explicitly without printing the backlog.

Wait recomputes the persona-visible semantic view after pile changes and also
sweeps Habits as wall time advances. A cooldown becoming due or a Habit entering
an attention state can therefore wake it without any pile growth. The current
`pile net sync` can repair native collection records and requested blobs for an
explicitly activated descriptor, but `orient wait` is still what turns newly
arrived state into a local notification. `orient poll` performs that pile-backed
news check without blocking; `--peek` reports without adding any `Presented`
facts.

Process wake and model-turn wake are separate. In Codex, use `orient daemon`
with the `faculties/hooks/codex/orient_queue.sh` delivery callback. The daemon
retains its open pile and sends one complete report on callback stdin; the
callback queues it to the exact owning thread. It does not also print news to
tool output. Callback success records presentation, not completion of the work.
Failure exits the daemon without marking that report seen; there is no retry
loop. Remove old rearm and prompt-time peek hooks before enabling it. See
[Harness Hooks: Mechanical Agent Sync](wiki:5c86df3dcd5994de2967483fca7170ac)
for the persona/session distinction and handover procedure.

Habit evaluation selects global intentions and those explicitly targeting
this persona, before loading their condition, nudge or script. Create a
personal clock with `habit add ... --persona <label-or-exact-id>`; repeat
the flag for several recipients. Omitting it means everyone, even when
`PERSONA` is set. `show` without a persona selects global habits only.
This is attention routing, not authorship or an authorization boundary.

== When not to use it

  - If you already know what you are doing, keep working
  - For one narrow query, prefer `compass list doing` or
    `message list "$PERSONA"`
