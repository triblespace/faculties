= Recipe: Multi-Agent Coordination

How several agents sharing one pile divide work, hand it off, and review one
another without a shadow workflow. This recipe chains `relations`, `message`,
`orient`, and `compass`. Processes may share one pile, or operators may activate
the exact descriptors between independent piles after installing appropriate
READ and WRITE proofs. Faculty names alone never imply network sharing.

== Setup once

```sh
relations add agent-a
relations add agent-b
relations add agent-c
relations add operator
relations group create agents
relations group add agents agent-a
relations group add agents agent-b
relations group add agents agent-c

export PERSONA=agent-a
```

Relations supplies stable person identities and groups. `$PERSONA` attributes
ordinary status and note events; it is not a cryptographic authority claim.

== Work hand-off

```sh
# Agent A claims and works.
GOAL=<existing-goal-id>
compass move "$GOAL" doing
compass note "$GOAL" "Claimed by agent-a; draft at wiki:<fragment>"

# If another agent must continue, send the conversational context directly.
compass move "$GOAL" blocked
message send agent-b "Please continue $GOAL from wiki:<fragment>"

# Agent B's watcher surfaces the message; B acknowledges and claims.
export PERSONA=agent-b
orient show
message ack <message-id> "$PERSONA"
compass move "$GOAL" doing
```

The Compass status and notes are the durable work ledger. The message carries
the human-readable hand-off and acknowledgement. For a lightweight directed
assignment, tag a goal with the recipient's own relations label; to draw one
person or a whole group to a goal or note once, write `@label` in its text.
Use a message when context or an explicit reply matters.

== Asynchronous diagnostic review

Review is observation, not a state machine. Ask for it through the normal
coordination primitives, naming the exact artifact:

```sh
message send agent-b \
  "Please diagnose git+https://example.org/repo@<full-oid>; reply with observations and evidence."
```

A useful report records:

  - the exact artifact or revision inspected
  - the observed behavior and its location
  - evidence, impact, and uncertainty
  - enough context for another agent to reproduce the observation

The reviewer describes the problem and does not mandate a particular repair.
The author keeps developing; review does not own Compass status or imply
acceptance. When a report arrives, first check whether it still applies to the
current artifact. If it does, create or annotate an ordinary follow-up goal.
If subsequent deletion or redesign already resolved it, record that diagnosis
as stale and move on.

This makes review asynchronous in the strong sense: a reviewer can work at
their own pace, and their report remains useful evidence without becoming a
global lock. Release or publication boundaries may impose their own policy,
but that policy is separate from Compass and from the diagnostic record.

== Persistent notifications for idle agents

For Codex, use one daemon in the owning window's environment:

```sh
orient --pile "$PILE" --persona "$PERSONA" daemon \
  --callback /bin/sh \
  --callback-arg "$PWD/faculties/hooks/codex/orient_queue.sh" \
  --callback-arg "$CODEX_THREAD_ID"
```

Use the installed release, and retain or supervise that one daemon process.
The persona is the attention recipient; the Codex thread id is the destination
session. No rearming is needed after delivery. Remove the old watcher/rearm
and prompt-time peek hooks first, and do not forward the daemon's output as
another message. One callback invocation is the only delivery path.
Manual `orient poll` and one-shot `orient wait` remain available when needed.

With a persona set, the watcher wakes for directed news: unread inbox or group
messages, goals and notes that `@`-mention the persona or one of its Relations
groups, other people's status changes and notes on goals tagged with the
persona's own label, and newly status-bearing windows. Group-name tags are
topics and wake nobody, and writing on a goal subscribes nobody. An agent's own
status edits stay quiet. Habit sweeps include global intentions and those
explicitly addressed to this persona. Give a personal clock an explicit
target when creating it:

```sh
habit add my-tick --when "every 20m" --nudge "Check my current work" --persona "$PERSONA"
```

Repeat `--persona` for several recipients. Omit it for a global intention;
the authoring command never inherits `PERSONA` as a target implicitly.
