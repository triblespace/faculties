= Compass Goals Workflow

`compass` is the goal/task tracker. Use it instead of
Claude Code's TaskCreate/TaskUpdate — compass goals persist
across sessions and merge between agents; the harness's task
list does neither.

== Statuses

  - `todo` — queued, not started
  - `doing` — actively in progress
  - `blocked` — waiting on something external
  - `review` — bound to an exact candidate awaiting heterogeneous settlement
  - `done` — finished, with an outcome note

Stick to those five unless there's a strong reason to introduce
another.

== Daily flow

  + `compass list` — see your active goals
  + Pick one, `compass move <id> doing` — claim it
  + Add notes as you decide things: `compass note <id> "..."`
  + Add a final note recording the outcome
  + For ordinary bookkeeping goals: `compass move <id> done`
  + For anything bound for a project's main branch: use the
    settlement flow below
  + Repeat

== Exact review settlement

Review is not a free-form status. `review open` atomically binds an
immutable artifact revision, freezes a review council,
and moves the goal to `review`:

```sh
# Every review action is attributed to the active relations identity.
export PERSONA=liora-gpt

compass review open "$GOAL" \
  --target 'git+https://example.org/repo@<full-commit-oid>' \
  --review-group review-pair \
  --override-authority jp
# → request id
```

The named group is read once. Its sorted-unique active person IDs are copied
into the request, so later membership changes cannot rewrite history. There is
no fixed council-size cutoff: the author must be in the roster and at least one
distinct peer must also be present. Soft retirement prevents future assignment
but
does not revoke a submit/settle/override role already frozen into a request.
Create a dedicated `review-pair`, `review-triad`, or other intentional council
group; the general `liora` broadcast group contains role zooids and is not a
roster. The unchanged `review-triad` CLI default keeps existing councils
working, while pair gates name their two-person group explicitly.

The request appears automatically in every reviewer's `orient show`.
`orient poll` and `orient wait` wake the peer reviewer(s); the author made
the request and sees their own outstanding attestation in the snapshot. No
hand-written notification message is needed. Reviewers deliberately attest
the *request id*, not the goal id, each with `$PERSONA` set to their own label:

```sh
compass review submit "$REQUEST" approve \
  --report @review-card.txt
```

Verdicts are `approve`, `request-changes`, or `abstain`. Reports are
mandatory: this is evidence, not ceremonial voting. Every frozen reviewer
must submit; every non-author must approve; the author may approve or abstain;
any `request-changes` closes the gate.

```sh
compass review status "$REQUEST"
compass review gate "$REQUEST"       # non-zero while closed
compass review settle "$REQUEST"     # records proof + moves goal to done
```

Requests and attestations use explicit `supersedes` edges. After a commit,
rebase, or other candidate change, run `review open` again with the new exact
target. That successor request supersedes every current request head, makes
the old evidence stale, and automatically re-notifies the peer reviewers.
Concurrent successors remain an honest visible fork and fail closed. A new
`review open` may supersede all fork heads only with a genuinely changed
immutable target absent from every head. Same-target fork repair is
deliberately refused until it has its own explicit proof protocol. No mutable
"current" or "approved" flag exists.

Changing only the roster for the *same* immutable target is a narrower,
fail-closed operation:

```sh
compass review supersede "$REQUEST" --review-group review-pair
```

Only the frozen author may do this, and the named request must be the unique,
unsettled, structurally valid head. The successor preserves the exact goal,
target, author, and break-glass authority. A reviewer may be removed only if
they have never submitted any attestation entity for the old request — stale,
forked, malformed, unknown, abstaining, approving, and change-request evidence
all count. The old request and every old attestation remain immutable history;
every member of the successor roster starts pending and must attest anew.
`review open` refuses every same-target ordinary successor, including author,
roster, override, and fork rewrites. This remains monotone under append-only
predecessor backpatches because the successor target is sealed and the old
target fact cannot disappear. Identity-sealed roster-predecessor markers let
the projection validate the complete same-target lineage after merge. A
settlement on any ancestor closes every descendant; if a later roster removes
a reviewer present on any ancestor, every attestation entity that reviewer
submitted on that ancestor counts. This catches add-then-remove chains and
late grandparent evidence instead of letting them disappear behind an
immediate-predecessor check.

Request, attestation, override, and settlement IDs are derived from all of
their proof-defining fields. Append-only back-patching therefore makes an
event non-canonical and closes the gate instead of rewriting what it meant.
Guarded writes use compare-and-swap: if the Compass branch changes between
the check and publish, the command re-reads the merged state and re-evaluates
before committing. After replicas merge, an ordinary certificate remains
valid only while all of its sealed attestations are the unique active heads.
An offline-concurrent vote therefore fails closed instead of being mistaken
for later discussion. Put post-settlement discussion in goal notes; any new
review evidence or changed work opens an explicit successor request.

A single frozen override authority, independent from the author and acting
under their own `$PERSONA`, may use
`compass review override "$REQUEST" --reason @reason.txt`. The bench keeps
the closed review in history, labels it `OVERRIDDEN`, preserves every blocker,
and never displays it as unanimous approval. Once a goal has structured
review history, every raw `compass move` is rejected; successor requests and
settlements are the only transitions that can preserve the exact proof.

The normal target parser accepts full Git object IRIs and recognized content
hash schemes. An opaque IRI requires the conspicuous
`--unsafe-opaque-target` acknowledgement because Compass cannot prove that a
generic URL is immutable. Persona labels are currently cooperative relations
claims, not cryptographic signatures; intrinsic identity protects proof
content, while authenticated actor capabilities remain a separate layer.

== Hierarchy

`compass add "<title>" --parent <id>` creates a sub-goal. Use
this when a goal naturally breaks into 3+ steps you'll want to
track separately. Don't sub-goal trivial steps — the conversation
itself is the right level for "and now do X".

== Tags

Compass tags work like wiki tags. Common ones:
`#meta`, `#bootstrap`, `#parking` (see Scope Control below),
plus project-specific tags (`#liora` in the Liora project,
`#deploy` for ops work, etc.).

== Scope control: parking lot

Mid-task ideas that would take >2 minutes go in compass with
a `#parking` or `#later` tag. Then *return to the current goal*.
Near the end of a session, do a parking-lot sweep: promote
0–2 parked items to active, leave the rest.

The parking discipline keeps the agent from infinitely-context-
switching and producing nothing. Compass is the queue; the
conversation is the executor.

== When NOT to use compass

  - In-conversation TodoWrite-style step planning is fine for
    "the next 20 minutes" — compass is for goals you'd want to
    pick up later, including in a future session.
  - Pure scratch state ("what was I about to do") — that's the
    conversation itself.
