= Substrate 3/4: Monotonic Merge

Why can independently extended pile states converge
without a mutable coordinator once they are exchanged? Because native storage
exposes grow-only sets of blobs, signed COMMIT assertions, and reproducible
equations. Within each exact descriptor-policy collection, the semantic value is a union of
fact archives signed by keys with exact positive WRITE authority. COMMITs from
unauthorized keys can coexist in the physical pile while remaining inert to the
current faculty view.

== The shape

```
agent A's facts        agent B's facts
┌─────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐
│ {f1, f2, f3}│       │ {f2, f4}    │
└──────┬──────┘       └──────┬──────┘
       └──────── union ──────┘
                  ▼
        ┌──────────────────┐
        │ {f1, f2, f3, f4} │   ← same result in ANY order,
        └──────────────────┘     merged ANY number of times
```

Union is commutative, associative, and idempotent. Readers using the same exact
collection descriptor, author key, admitted record set, and required blob
closure compute the same value regardless of arrival order or duplication.
Different author/admission views or missing blobs remain explicit boundaries,
not hidden last-writer arbitration.

== Why there are no conflicts

A conflict needs two writers disagreeing about one mutable cell. There are no
mutable cells: facts are immutable and content-addressed, so two agents stating
the same thing produce the *same bytes* (dedup, not conflict), and two agents
stating different things produce *two facts* that coexist. Each faculty gives
its apparent mutable state explicit domain semantics: a revision DAG may expose
two concurrent frontier states, while an event ledger may reduce observations
by a declared ordering. Disagreement is data, not a write error.

== Monotonicity at the fact-query layer

The positive constraint language is monotone over a supplied fact set: adding
a fact can add matches but does not erase an existing match. It deliberately
does not smuggle closed-world negation into an open dataset. Faculty read models
may still compute explicitly non-monotone projections such as a revision DAG's
maximal frontier or the latest checkpoint under a declared total order. Those
semantics live in the domain model; they are not ambient storage arbitration.

== What this buys multi-agent collaboration on shared or merged storage

  - No coordinator, no leader election, no lock service.
  - Offline construction followed by deterministic convergence once the same
    authorized record and blob closure is present.
  - Network participation is explicit per descriptor. Discovery may announce
    only that a peer has new state; semantic disclosure requires a valid READ
    proof for that exact collection.
  - Anti-entropy carries sparse signed evidence, not permission or automatic
    full replication. Referenced blobs remain lazy until local WANT
    policy asks for them.
  - Trust per assertion, not per channel: COMMITs are signed, so provenance
    survives any path. Semantic admission still applies exact positive
    WRITE authority when materializing the collection view.

[Substrate 1/4: What Is a Trible](wiki:4e19893b36bf37d471bb9ea968edac20) and [Substrate 2/4: The Pile](wiki:5232ea531fedfcb17bf15e88c3d52a36) cover the building blocks. The query-language chapter
of the `triblespace-rs` book covers monotone queries in
depth; native collection publication binds each COMMIT to an exact descriptor
and author key. The descriptor's READ policy governs disclosure, while its
WRITE policy governs which authors contribute to the semantic value.
