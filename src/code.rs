//! The source catalogue: what exists, what uses what, and what is defined where.
//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! `grep` answers "where does this text appear". It cannot answer "do we
//! already have a GPU graph layout", because the answer does not contain the
//! words you would search for; and it cannot answer "this is absent" with a
//! denominator, because it only ever reports what it found in the tree it was
//! pointed at. Those two are what this faculty exists for. It is not a search
//! engine and it is not a second copy of the source.
//!
//! # Three bright lines against the shadow model
//!
//! A code catalogue is the most tempting possible place to build one, so these
//! are stated rather than assumed, and they are the thing to check in review:
//!
//! 1. **Every relation projection in this module is exactly one `find!`,**
//!    generic over `P: TriblePattern + ?Sized`, returning a `Vec` of tuples or
//!    of a row type that query alone fills. A DISPLAY row
//!    ([`operations::Hit`]) is assembled at the point of use from several of
//!    them — but only for results that already survived a relation query, never
//!    ahead of a question, and never kept.
//! 2. **No value read from the pile may outlive the function that queried it.**
//!    No `OnceLock`, no `lazy_static`, no struct field holding query results, no
//!    `Catalog`. If you find yourself typing `fn load_all_items() -> Vec<Item>`,
//!    stop. The one memo in the codebase is
//!    `operations::Texts`, which caches blob TEXT by content handle for the
//!    length of one command: nothing queries it, nothing joins against it, and
//!    it answers no question the pile was not asked.
//! 3. **[`extract`] may not name a `Pile`, `Storage`, `Collection` or
//!    `TribleSet` in any signature.** It is pure and unit-testable on fixture
//!    strings; its output is one file's parse, consumed into fragments and
//!    dropped.
//!
//! # Identity
//!
//! An ITEM is identified by its normalized token stream alone, so byte-identical
//! code in two files is ONE item with two PLACEMENTs and duplication is exhaust
//! rather than a feature that had to be built. A UNIT is one `(repo, path,
//! content)` triple, so re-ingesting an unchanged file is a no-op and two
//! machines scanning the same commit converge. Everything a judgement produced
//! — kind, name, doc, signature, visibility, mentions — annotates those cores
//! instead of entering them, so a better extractor re-annotates the same
//! entities rather than re-minting the world.
//!
//! Nothing here computes or validates a derived id in order to look something
//! up. Ids come back from [`Fragment::root`] and are treated as opaque. Swap
//! every one of them for a fresh `genid` and only idempotence breaks: duplicates
//! become distinct items with one placement each, re-ingest grows the pile, and
//! nothing else notices.
//!
//! A `Handle<UTF8String>` computed from a query string and used in `pattern!`
//! value position is NOT the hash-join sin. That rule governs derived ENTITY
//! ids. A handle is a content-addressed VALUE, and `pattern!` folds literal
//! values to constants by exactly the same path
//! (`triblespace-core/src/inline.rs:564`).
