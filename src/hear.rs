//! Hearing: shared utterance segmentation, filtering and native embeddings.
//!
//! Recorded clips use resident bytes and explicit local model configuration.
//! The CLI alone owns Soma listening, software pause-file holds and historical
//! JSONL/raw-file handover. Capture stays open during holds; completed live
//! utterances are resampled once, never one capture frame at a time.
