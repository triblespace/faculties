//! Canonical root descriptors for faculty collections.
//!
//! A root collection used to be anchored by an opaque minted scope id. It
//! discriminated roots correctly and told a reader nothing: the id lived as a
//! hex constant in one faculty's source, so "which collection is this?" was
//! answerable only by someone holding the code. A root is now a self-describing
//! fragment containing its name, representation, and immutable READ and WRITE
//! admission policies. The fragment's content handle is the collection
//! identity.
//!
//! The scope ids have not gone anywhere — they remain each schema's stable
//! identifier and the key this table is read by, because the migration that
//! re-seats existing data has to speak both languages at once.
