//! Durable signing identity and native-collection plumbing shared by every faculty.
//!
//! Three concerns that every faculty needs before it can read or write
//! anything, and that none of them should re-implement:
//!
//! - **Signing identity.** [`signer_path`], [`load_signer`], and [`initialize_signer`]
//!   resolve one durable signing key per pile. Ordinary commands load; only an
//!   explicit initialization mints. No faculty falls back to an ephemeral
//!   identity.
//! - **Opening.** [`open_store`] supplies lazy exact-handle acquisition;
//!   [`open_pile_strict`] is the local-only boundary used by migrations and
//!   not-yet-ported callers. Both report a malformed suffix as evidence through
//!   [`pile_read_error`] rather than silently truncating it.
//! - **Publication and discovery.** [`publish_fragment`] / [`publish_fragments`]
//!   commit whole fragments into one scoped collection; [`discover_target`]
//!   reports what a scope already holds.
//!
//! This module was carved out of the storage cutover, which is where these
//! primitives were first written. The cutover itself now lives in the separate
//! `faculties-migrations` crate and depends on this module rather than the
//! other way round.
