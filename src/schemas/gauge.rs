//! Gauge schema: re-exports the subset of wiki attributes that the gauge
//! faculty reads when computing research quality metrics.
//!
//! Gauge is a read-only lens on wiki tag metadata — it does not define
//! its own attribute IDs. Keeping this module here lets downstream
//! consumers of the gauge faculty mirror the same attribute view.
