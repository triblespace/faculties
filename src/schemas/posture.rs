//! Posture schema: candidate redaction points, and — just as importantly —
//! what was *not* examined.
//!
//! `posture` finds material in a corpus that may identify someone: metadata a
//! document carries without showing it, the author field nobody looks at, GPS
//! on a field photograph. It never decides. It surfaces candidates and a human
//! adjudicates, so the tuning is for recall.
//!
//! The unusual part of this schema is [`posture::unchecked`]. A redaction tool
//! that reports "clean" manufactures exactly the false confidence that gets a
//! source burned — and the failure is not hypothetical: a verification grep
//! reported clean on a repository that still held an entire private narrative,
//! because the narrative contained none of the searched tokens. So a scan
//! records the modalities it applied AND the modalities it did not, as facts.
//! "No OCR was run on the scanned pages" is then queryable, not a footnote
//! someone forgot to write.
//!
//! Documents that no extractor understood are recorded too, tagged
//! [`DOC_UNSUPPORTED`], so "which files did this scan never actually look
//! inside?" has an answer.
//!
//! The original domain ids were minted with `trible genid` on 2026-08-04
//! (compass ceabb6c1). Collection scopes and the immutable policy/scan ids were
//! minted with `trible genid` on 2026-08-08 while porting the faculty.
