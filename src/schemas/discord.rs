//! Discord schema: stable upstream anchors, immutable semantic observations,
//! attachment occurrences, and explicit ingestion coverage.
//!
//! Used by `discord.rs` (the faculty CLI). Message observations use the generic
//! `archive::*` schema for their common projection (author / content / reply_to
//! / kind_message); this module owns only Discord-specific identity and
//! context. Attachment occurrences link to canonical file records built with
//! the shared `faculties::files` model.
//!
//! ## Identity
//!
//! Discord snowflakes are globally unique upstream, but mutable Discord
//! resources must not become mutable entities in a union-only collection. A
//! message snowflake therefore derives a stable identity anchor carrying only
//! [`discord::message_id`]. Each semantic version is a separate intrinsic
//! observation linked to that anchor through [`discord::message`]. Volatile
//! REST response state is deliberately absent. Discord users follow the same
//! pattern: messages point to stable user anchors, while names are independent
//! profile observations.
//!
//! Coverage is an integer interval `(after_exclusive, through_inclusive]`, not
//! a scalar high-water mark. Baseline intervals make the intentionally bounded
//! first import explicit; ordinary intervals may advance a reader only when
//! they connect to that baseline cover.
