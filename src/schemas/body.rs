//! Body schema: the Reachy Mini body — perception in, action out — and the
//! deliberate sensory/touch captures it keeps in the pile.
//!
//! Renamed from `senses` (2026-06-16): the faculty is both afferent
//! (perception: look/listen/pose/feel) and efferent (action: gesture/move),
//! the whole embodied loop a vision-language-action model closes. "Body" is
//! the honest name for that loop.
//!
//! Only DELIBERATE captures land here — "I choose to remember this". The
//! continuous perception stream (live camera/mic/encoders) stays ephemeral
//! and is never minted into facts (periphery principle): there is no
//! continuous-capture command, so the ephemerality is structural.
//!
//! Each capture entity carries the raw payload (for vision: a PNG frame; for
//! touch: no payload, the signature lives in `pose`), the modality, optional
//! geometry, an optional deliberate note ("why I kept this"), and the
//! proprioceptive context at capture time (JSON state / touch signature) so a
//! future VLA model can ground the moment in the body state that produced it.
