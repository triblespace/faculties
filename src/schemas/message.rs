//! Collection-native local messaging schema.

//! A message is the canonical intrinsic identity of one complete immutable
//! envelope. A read acknowledgement is likewise the canonical intrinsic fact
//! `(message, reader)`; optional timestamps are merely additive evidence about
//! that fact. Group delivery records the stable group anchor, the exact
//! immutable Relations group snapshot used for delivery, and a typed basis for
//! that choice, so later membership edits cannot rewrite an old audience and a
//! migration cannot masquerade inferred history as directly witnessed fact.
