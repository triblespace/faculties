//! Canonical block-DAG archive schema.
//!
//! Archive data is split into semantic/source-occurrence layers plus an
//! orthogonal exact-source substrate:
//!
//! ```text
//! content fact  -- semantic datum (text, media, tool payload, ...)
//! content part  -- ordinal-bearing occurrence of one fact inside a block
//! block         -- structural event in the predecessor DAG
//! source projection -- exact vendor occurrence projected onto one block
//! source chunk      -- reusable content-addressed source byte range
//! source snapshot   -- exact ordered version of one source file
//! ```
//!
//! The first three layers are structural hash-consing. Source multiplicity,
//! actor pairing, vendor ids, and movable paths belong only to projection
//! receipts. This lets repeated exports converge without erasing how often a
//! source actually emitted the event.
//!
//! The block/content-fact ids and attributes preserve the approved
//! `8011a65..a2e575c` design lineage. The scope, content-part, media-type, and
//! projection ids below were minted with `trible genid` on 2026-08-08; their
//! exact values are kept here beside the protocol they identify.
