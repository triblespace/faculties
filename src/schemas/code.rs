//! Collection-native source-code catalogue ontology.
//!
//! An ITEM is a declaration identified by its normalized token stream and
//! nothing else, so byte-identical code in two files is ONE item with two
//! PLACEMENTs. A UNIT is one `(repo, path, content)` triple. A SCAN is one
//! observation of one repo at one commit.
//!
//! Everything a judgement produced — kind, name, doc, signature, visibility,
//! mentions — ANNOTATES a core that only the bytes and the grammar determined,
//! so a better extractor re-annotates the same entities instead of re-minting
//! the world, and the two generations union cleanly under `cat`.
//!
//! Duplication is therefore exhaust rather than a feature: a clone is an item
//! with two placements, found by a self-join, with no hash attribute and no
//! hashing pass. Re-ingesting an unchanged tree is a no-op, and two machines
//! scanning the same commit produce the same entities, because nothing
//! machine-local (absolute path, wall clock, iteration order) reaches a core.

becomes one item. Its token stream is normalized by walking the item's tokens \
depth-first, emitting each leaf token's textual spelling, emitting a group's \
delimiters as their literal open and close characters around its contents, and \
joining every emitted piece with a single ASCII space. Whitespace, formatting \
and plain `//` comments therefore do not participate in identity, while `///` \
doc comments do, because they are `#[doc = \"...\"]` tokens. A mention is any \
identifier the declaration syntactically names, including every segment of a \
path, the full `::`-joined spelling of that path, and identifiers and paths \
recovered from inside macro token streams; mentions are unresolved, so they \
witness spelling rather than binding. A file that does not parse yields a unit \
carrying a parse error and no items.";
