//! Decide schema: deliberation primitive shared across faculties.
//!
//! A *decision* is a small append-only deliberation: a title + optional
//! context, zero-or-more pro factors, zero-or-more con factors, and an
//! eventual resolution (outcome text + finished_at timestamp). Decisions
//! can be linked to whatever they're *about* via `decide::about` — a mail
//! draft, a compass goal, an arbitrary topic — and other faculties gate
//! their own high-stakes actions on a resolved decision.
//!
//! The point isn't to *extract* a machine-readable verdict from the
//! decision (the outcome is free-form text and remains so); the point is
//! to nudge the deliberation into existence. `decide resolve` itself
//! enforces the "≥1 pro AND ≥1 con" gate (with `--force` as the explicit
//! bypass — a resolved decision with no factors is by definition a
//! forced one, no separate flag needed in the schema). Downstream
//! faculties just check "is it resolved?" and trust the system.
//!
//! Most metadata is reused: `metadata::name` for the decision's title
//! and a factor's text, `metadata::description` for longer context,
//! `metadata::created_at` for proposal time, `metadata::finished_at`
//! for resolution time, `metadata::tag` for kind markers. Only three
//! attrs are unique to decide.
