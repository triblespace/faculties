//! Planner schema: calendar events (RFC 5545 VEVENT-shaped) plus
//! the notes a user attaches to them.
//!
//! Used by `planner.rs` (the faculty CLI). Decomposes RFC 5545
//! VEVENT properties into individual triblespace attributes so
//! queries are native pile patterns; round-trips back to `.ics`
//! by re-serializing the attributes.
//!
//! All-day events are stored as a 24-hour `NsTAIInterval` window
//! at UTC midnight (multi-day all-day events span the whole
//! contiguous range). Re-exporting to `.ics` would emit
//! `DTSTART;VALUE=DATE-TIME` rather than `DTSTART;VALUE=DATE`;
//! that's a v1 acceptable lossiness — the `all_day` boolean
//! re-export hint can be added later if it becomes a problem.
