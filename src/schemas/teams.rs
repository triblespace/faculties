//! Canonical Microsoft Teams observation and synchronization schema.
//!
//! Teams data is an append-only collection of source-scoped identities,
//! immutable message/attachment observations, and causal page-coverage
//! receipts. Public authentication configuration is represented by immutable
//! source-scoped profile snapshots. Secret-bearing fields are never embedded
//! here: profiles name exact encrypted versions in the configured Secrets
//! collection.
//!
//! Attachment occurrence entities preserve immutable source evidence
//! (message, source-local id/kind, and occurrence name). Source URLs are
//! repeatable provenance, while canonical file records and byte sizes are
//! additive materializations. This makes fetching ordinary pointer-only Graph
//! attachments a later collection-native DERIVE rather than a rewrite of the
//! source page or a change to attachment identity.
