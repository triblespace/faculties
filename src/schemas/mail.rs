//! Mail schema: RFC 5322-shaped email messages stored as tribles.
//!
//! Used by `mail.rs` (the faculty CLI). Decomposes incoming and
//! outgoing email into individual triblespace attributes so
//! queries are native pile patterns (joins on sender/recipient,
//! range scans on `sent_at`, BM25 search over body/subject,
//! thread walks via `in_reply_to+` and `references` graph edges).
//!
//! Mail entities use **deterministic ids derived from
//! `blake3(Message-Id).first 16 bytes`** — `in_reply_to` and
//! `references` GenIds point at predicted entity ids, so a
//! thread reference resolves whether or not the referenced
//! message is in our pile yet. When that message arrives later
//! (via a separate fetch, forward, or backup pull), its entity
//! materializes at the predicted id and the link goes live with
//! no patching.
//!
//! Attachments live in the `files` faculty (`KIND_FILE`,
//! `file::content` / `file::name` / `file::mime`); the mail
//! message references them via `mail::attachment: GenId` so
//! attachment dedup (BLAKE3 over file bytes) is automatic
//! across mail and the rest of the pile.
//!
//! Spam is a kind tag (`metadata::tag: &KIND_SPAM`) rather than
//! a boolean attribute — matches the canonical kind-marker
//! convention and lets manual reclassification stay
//! append-only-safe.
