//! Voice schema: a text-to-speech faculty — speech out, on two channels, with a
//! pile-backed routing policy that decides which audio device each channel
//! plays through.
//!
//! Extracted from `body` (2026-06-30): speaking is its own organ, not a limb of
//! the Reachy body. The body stays the physical Reachy loop (pose/look/feel/act);
//! the voice owns synthesis (F5/mary) and output
//! routing. New utterances and routing config live in one fixed native
//! collection. The historical `voice` Repository branch is migration input
//! only and is never consulted by the live faculty.
//!
//! Two channels, each a hard contract — NOT a soft preference:
//! - `say` — the PRIVATE channel: in-ear/headphone only. If no private device
//!   is connected it falls back to printing text. There is no code path that
//!   lets a `say` utterance play through a room speaker (the invariant is
//!   enforced in `voice.rs`, not here).
//! - `shout` — the PUBLIC channel: broadcast freely (Reachy speaker → room →
//!   laptop), audible by design.
//!
//! Routing is an ORDERED list of device preferences per channel: a `KIND_ROUTE`
//! entity per (channel, device, priority). At speak-time the faculty reads the
//! preferences, intersects with the actually-connected devices, and (for `say`)
//! re-checks each candidate is a private device before it plays. The list is
//! advisory ordering; the privacy guarantee is code, so no misconfiguration can
//! leak a private utterance into a room.
